# Contributing

## Development Flow

1. Run `./scripts/check.sh` before pushing changes.
2. Use `./script/build_and_run.sh` to validate the packaged app path.
3. Update docs when changing:
   - permissions
   - hotkeys
   - provider configuration
   - packaging or startup behavior

## Coding Standards

- Keep files focused and macOS-native.
- Prefer AppKit for system integration and SwiftUI for bounded settings surfaces.
- Avoid hidden magic defaults. Expose operator-facing configuration clearly.
- Keep comments sparse and only where they reduce real ambiguity.

## Verification

Minimum verification for product changes:

- `swift build --package-path .`
- `swift test --package-path .`
- packaged app launch through `./script/build_and_run.sh`

For UI changes, verify the actual window or HUD behavior in the running app.
