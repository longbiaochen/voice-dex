# ChatType

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

`ChatType` is a native macOS dictation app for people who already use ChatGPT through a local Codex desktop session and want the fastest possible `F5 -> speak -> paste` workflow.

Public landing page: [longbiaochen.github.io/chat-type](https://longbiaochen.github.io/chat-type/)

It is intentionally opinionated:

- global `F5` hotkey
- native menu bar app
- zero-config default route through your local Codex desktop login state
- single-stage STT output tuned for direct paste
- conservative paste behavior
- clipboard fallback when paste is not safe
- manual TypeWhisper terminology import for stronger post-STT term alignment
- optional advanced recovery route for OpenAI-compatible APIs

## Product Promise

- No extra dictation subscription
- No API key in the normal path
- No local model download or tuning
- Install once, sign into Codex on this Mac, press `F5`, speak, and get text back

## Current Status

`ChatType` `v0.1.2` is the current public release. `./scripts/package_app.sh` expects a stable local signing identity and emits a locally signed, non-notarized `.app` plus GitHub release `.zip` and `.dmg` artifacts.

## How It Works

1. Install `ChatType`
2. Install the packaged app to `/Applications/ChatType.app`, then launch that installed copy on a Mac that already has Codex desktop installed and signed in with ChatGPT
3. Grant microphone permission
4. If microphone access was denied earlier, use `Open Microphone Settings` in `ChatType Settings`
5. If you want auto-paste, use `Guide Accessibility Access` in `ChatType Settings`
6. `ChatType` opens the Accessibility page and shows a drag-to-authorize helper around the packaged app
7. If `ChatType` still does not appear there, click `+` in Accessibility and add `/Applications/ChatType.app`
8. Put the cursor in Notes, Mail, Slack, Codex, or another editable target
9. Press `F5`, speak, press `F5` again
10. `ChatType` sends the recording through the local login-state bridge to the ChatGPT backend transcription path
11. Optional: import a TypeWhisper terminology snapshot in Settings to strengthen post-STT technical-term alignment
12. `ChatType` applies a deterministic local terminology-alignment pass plus any hidden exact `hintTerms`
13. The result is pasted into the focused app or left in the clipboard when paste is not safe
14. Chinese output defaults to Simplified Chinese unless the original speech clearly asks for Traditional Chinese

## Installation

### Downloaded app

1. Build and package:

```bash
./scripts/package_app.sh
```

2. Install the packaged app to `/Applications`:

```bash
./scripts/install_app.sh
```

If you intentionally need an ad-hoc build for throwaway debugging, opt into it explicitly:

```bash
CHATTYPE_ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1 ./scripts/package_app.sh
```

That fallback is not recommended for normal use. On recent macOS versions it can still leave Accessibility without a toggleable `ChatType` row, which is why the packaged `/Applications/ChatType.app` path matters for the new guided repair flow as well.

3. Launch the installed app:

```bash
open -n /Applications/ChatType.app
```

Do not launch `dist/ChatType.app` directly. The `dist` copy is packaging output only; live permissions and verification must bind to `/Applications/ChatType.app`.

4. If macOS blocks the app on first launch:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/ChatType.app
```

### Homebrew Cask metadata

Homebrew packaging metadata lives at:

```text
packaging/homebrew/Casks/chattype.rb
```

This repo does not yet publish a dedicated Homebrew tap, but the cask file is kept current with the release artifact format.

### Release Download

- Releases: [github.com/longbiaochen/chat-type/releases](https://github.com/longbiaochen/chat-type/releases)
- Current release page: [v0.1.2](https://github.com/longbiaochen/chat-type/releases/tag/v0.1.2)

## TypeWhisper Terminology Import

`ChatType` still avoids a second AI cleanup pass in the default product path.

Instead, `v0.1.2` adds a deterministic terminology-alignment layer:

- import a TypeWhisper terminology snapshot from Settings with `Import from TypeWhisper`
- keep the imported glossary as ChatType-owned local config
- align tool names, product names, and technical terms after STT without another model call
- keep hidden `transcription.hintTerms` as exact-only preservation hints for filenames and other critical literals

## Advanced Recovery Route

If the desktop-login path is unavailable, `ChatType` still includes an advanced recovery route for OpenAI-compatible transcription APIs.

That route is intentionally not part of the default onboarding. It requires:

- your own endpoint
- your own model choice
- your own API key environment variable

## Build And Verify

```bash
swift build --package-path .
swift test --package-path .
./scripts/check.sh
./script/build_and_run.sh
```

Benchmark the real packaged path with your own sample audio:

```bash
./scripts/benchmark_stt.sh ~/bench/3s.wav ~/bench/10s.wav ~/bench/30s.wav
```

Post a release update to X through `chrome-use` and the managed Chrome for Testing session:

```bash
scripts/post_x.sh --print "ChatType update"
scripts/post_x.sh "ChatType update"
```

The actual send path now uses the same Chrome for Testing browser session for publish and post-page verification. If X is not signed in there yet, sign in inside that managed browser session first.

## Config

`ChatType` stores runtime config at:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/ChatType/config.json
```

Advanced terminology options:

- import TypeWhisper terminology from the Settings window with `Import from TypeWhisper`
- keep `transcription.hintTerms` for exact-only custom terms you want preserved even without a TypeWhisper import

## Permission Repair

`ChatType Settings` now separates first-run prompts from repair actions:

- microphone first-run access still comes from the native macOS prompt when you record for the first time
- if microphone access was denied earlier, use `Open Microphone Settings` to jump straight to `Privacy & Security > Microphone`
- if Accessibility is missing, use `Guide Accessibility Access` to open the correct settings page and show the drag-to-authorize helper for `/Applications/ChatType.app`
- `Open Accessibility Settings` remains available as a simpler fallback when you only want the deeplink
- `Refresh Status` re-checks the live permission state after you return from System Settings

## Risks And Boundaries

`ChatType` V1 deliberately depends on a private backend path plus a local signed-in Codex desktop session.

That means:

- it is fast and simple for existing ChatGPT desktop users
- it may break if upstream desktop-login or backend behavior changes
- it is not positioned as an enterprise-safe or long-term stable public API integration
- the desktop bridge prompt path is opportunistic and falls back to plain transcription if unsupported
