# ChatType Release Process

## Local Release Checklist

1. Run `./scripts/check.sh`
2. Run `./scripts/package_app.sh`
3. Confirm the release assets exist:
   - `dist/ChatType-0.1.2-macos-arm64.zip`
   - `dist/ChatType-0.1.2-macos-arm64.dmg`
4. Install `dist/ChatType.app` to `/Applications/ChatType.app`
5. Launch `/Applications/ChatType.app`
6. Verify setup states:
   - signed-in Codex desktop session shows as ready
   - microphone state is reported correctly
   - Accessibility state is reported correctly
   - denied microphone state exposes `Open Microphone Settings`
   - missing Accessibility exposes `Guide Accessibility Access`, `Open Accessibility Settings`, and `Refresh Status`
7. Verify runtime behavior:
   - HUD appears on `F5`
   - recording stops on second `F5`
   - missing Codex desktop install produces a clear setup blocker
   - missing ChatGPT login in Codex produces a clear setup blocker
   - first-run microphone flow still surfaces the native macOS system prompt
   - denied microphone flow jumps to `Privacy & Security > Microphone`
   - Accessibility guidance opens the correct page and shows the drag-to-authorize helper for the packaged app
   - paste only reports success when an editable focus target exists
   - clipboard fallback keeps the latest transcript available for manual `Cmd+V`
   - settings do not expose a second AI cleanup stage in the main flow
   - TypeWhisper terminology import is visible in Settings and succeeds against a valid local dictionary
   - output remains directly usable without a second model call
8. Verify advanced recovery mode:
   - switching to `OpenAI-Compatible Recovery` exposes endpoint, model, and API env settings
   - missing API key in recovery mode produces a clear setup blocker
   - if `transcription.hintTerms` exists in config.json, filenames and product names are preserved
   - simplified Chinese remains the default when the recognizer drifts into Traditional Chinese
9. Re-test from the packaged release artifacts:
   - unzip `dist/ChatType-0.1.2-macos-arm64.zip`
   - install the extracted `ChatType.app` to `/Applications/ChatType.app`
   - launch `/Applications/ChatType.app`
   - mount `dist/ChatType-0.1.2-macos-arm64.dmg`
   - install the mounted `ChatType.app` to `/Applications/ChatType.app`
   - launch `/Applications/ChatType.app`
10. If you are announcing the release on X, preview the outgoing post first and send it through `chrome-use` on the managed Chrome for Testing session:
   - `scripts/post_x.sh --print "ChatType update"`
   - `scripts/post_x.sh "ChatType update"`
   - treat the post as complete only after the command returns the published post URL
11. Update docs if any onboarding, naming, packaging, or launch assumptions changed.

## Public Promotion Checklist

Use `docs/promotion/README.md` as the source of truth for low-cost public promotion.

Before posting to public channels:

1. Confirm the landing page, README, and release page describe the same default path: local Codex/ChatGPT Desktop login, `F5` recording, transcription, safe paste, and clipboard fallback.
2. Keep the private backend dependency explicit. Do not describe the default route as a stable public API.
3. Publish Chinese social content first, then V2EX, then Hacker News or Product Hunt only after real install feedback exists.
4. Do not ask for upvotes on Hacker News or Product Hunt.
5. Submit free or low-cost AI directories first; defer paid directory placement until the first week produces real signal.
6. Keep support copy framed as optional maintenance support, not a crowdfunding campaign.

## Gatekeeper Notes

`v0.1.2` is expected to be locally signed with Apple Development or Developer ID Application and is not notarized.

`./scripts/package_app.sh` now fails fast when no stable signing identity is available. Only use `CHATTYPE_ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1` for throwaway local debugging, because ad-hoc builds can break the Accessibility repair flow.

Do not verify or repair permissions from `dist/ChatType.app`. Install the packaged app to `/Applications/ChatType.app` first so TCC binds to the real runtime path.

If macOS blocks the app:

- right-click `ChatType.app` and choose `Open`
- or remove quarantine:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/ChatType.app
```

## Homebrew Cask

Keep the cask file aligned with the release artifact:

```text
packaging/homebrew/Casks/chattype.rb
```

If the asset filename or release URL format changes, update the cask in the same change.

## Follow-Up Work After v0.1.2

- notarize the `.app` or `.dmg`
- publish a dedicated Homebrew tap
- broaden first-run diagnostics for desktop-host failures
- keep benchmark samples around for 3s / 10s / 30s regression checks
